Files and folders of my Oven project

I used a modified Brit√¢nia brand kitchen oven. There are two resistors installed. One at the top described as Teto. Another at the bottom described as Lastro. Each of these resistors works together with a Type J Thermocouple Sensor next to it. So I have 02 sensors, one for the ceiling and another for the ballast where the temperature readings are taken. For 127 V activation I used FOTEK SSR-40 solid state relays. 3-32VDC input and 24-380VAC outputs work very well.

This project was made with ESP32 and OPPLER Hardware OPS012. Communication between the Bettwen Hardware (OPPLER OPS012 with ESP32) and (HMI DWIN DMG80480C070_15WTR) was done via RS232. I would like to have this communication via RS485. I couldn't do RS485 communication. Before arriving at this hardware, I did the project with Arduino and Raspberry Pi. This project is capable of working under any temperature control.

I made this other version of the project, with online activation that in the future I want to place the files in another branch. This version has a video on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7071414505255112704/

Some parts of the project you will see in Portuguese.
