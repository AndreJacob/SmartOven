# SmartOven
Files and folders from my Oven Project

I used a modified kitchen oven brand Brit√¢nia. There are two resistors installed. One at the top where I called the Teto. Another one at the bottom where I called Lastro. Each of these resistors works with a Type J Thermocouple Sensor next to it. Where temperature readings are taken.
For the 127V drive I used FOTEK SSR-40 Solid State Relays. 3-32VDC input and 24-380VAC outputs, works very well.

This procject was done with ESP32 and OPPLER Hardware OPS012.
The communication Bettwen Hardware (OPPLER OPS012 with ESP32) and (HMI DWIN DMG80480C070_15WTR) was done by RS232.
I would like to have this communication by RS485. I couldn't do that.

I did this another version to the project that I want to put the files in other branch.
This version has a video in linkedin:
